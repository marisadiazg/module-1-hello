**My First Page**


**Introduction**
In this project we are creating a responsive web page that is sensitive to the path entry, using node js, implementing 2 files, 1 is for creating the server, in which we are calling the other file like a exported module, n there we create the conditioned response to the different entry in paths.
In this web page you can create an account, log in to it and delete it if you want to.

**Installation and Usage instructions**
First you need to run your terminal, navigate to the path of your app, and make sure you have NodeJS installed, then clone the repository to your computer and run the module by typing the next command in your terminal **node [name of your app].js**
To test it, once your have run your js file:
1. go to your preferred browser and go to **localhost:8115/signup** and create an account.
2. go to  **localhost:8115/login** and enter to your account where you can see your name.
3. click delete if you want to test this method.
