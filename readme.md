#**My First Page**
##Introduction
In this project we are creating a responsive web page that is sensitive to the path entry, using node js, implementing 2 files, 1 is for creating the server, in which we are calling the other file like a exported module, n there we create the conditioned response to the different entry in paths

##Installation and Usage instructions
First you need to run your terminal, navigate to the path of your app, and make sure you have NodeJS installed, then clone the repository to your computer and run the module by typing the next command in your terminal **node [name of your app].js**
To test it, once your have run your js file, go to your preferred browser and go to **localhost:8080**.
