**My First Page**


**Introduction**
In this project we are creating a responsive web page that is sensitive to the path entry, using node js, implementing several files.
In this web page you can create an account, log in to it, add and display metrics. log out and delete it if you want to.

**Installation and Usage instructions**
First you need to run your terminal, navigate to the path where you saved the project, making sure you have NodeJS installed, and run the module by typing the next command in your terminal **npm start**
To test it, once your have run your js file:
1. go to your preferred browser and go to **localhost:8115**. This will redirect you to **localhost:8115/login**, where you can click on the button "create an account" and create an account.
2. you will see the message "User created" and now, you can go to  **localhost:8115/login** and enter to your account clicking the button "connect"
3. you will be redirect to the principal page, where you can see your name, add a number of steps and click "Bring the metrics" to see a graph. Then, click on the button "Delete" to delete the graph.
4. Finally, click "Delete user" to delete the account (if it send an error message, try again please, it works but sometimes fails and i dont know why **:(** ) or click "logout" to disconnect.
